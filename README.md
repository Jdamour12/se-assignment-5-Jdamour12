       - Follow the installation instructions and configure Git with your username and email:
         . git config --global user.name "Your Name"
         . git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

    2. Check Git Installation in VS Code:

    - Open VS Code.
    - Open Terminal in navigation bar or press "Ctrl+`" to open the integrated terminal.
    - Type "git --version" to verify Git is installed and recognized by VS Code.

    3. Initialize a Git Repository:

       1. Open Your Project Folder:

          - Go to "File > Open Folder" and select your project folder.

       2. Initialize the Repository:

          - Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+G.
          - Click the "Initialize" Repository button.

          - This will create a .git folder in your project directory.

    4. Making Commits:

       1. Stage Changes:

          - In the Source Control view, you'll see a list of changes.
          - Hover over a file and click the "+" icon to stage it, or click "+" next to Changes to stage all changes.

       2. Commit Changes:

       - Enter a commit message in the message box at the top of the Source Control view.
       - Click the "✔" (checkmark) icon to commit the staged changes.

11. Pushing Changes to GitHub:

    Create a GitHub Repository:

    - Go to GitHub and sign in.
    - Click the + icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.
    - Name your repository and click Create repository.

    Add Remote Repository:

    - Copy the repository URL.
    - In the VS Code terminal, add the remote repository: git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

    Push Changes:

    - In the VS Code terminal, push your changes to GitHub: git push -u origin main
    - If your default branch is master, use: git push -u origin master

Submission Guidelines:

- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
